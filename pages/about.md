I'm Rafael, a brazilian software developer currently living on the beautiful Barcelona.

Currently working at [Smart Focus][smartfocus], where I help to build a better marketing platform to send messages for billions of clients every month. Before that I've worked in a few startups such as [Creditas][creditas], one of the most exciting products of FinTech market in Brazil, and also helped bring [Tripda][tripda] to life.

I use to speak about front-end stuff at some local meetup groups, and I've presented sessions at [The Developers Conference][tdc] in 2014 and 2015.
