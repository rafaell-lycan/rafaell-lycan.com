I'm Rafael, a brazilian Software Engineer currently living on the sunny Barcelona.

Currently working at [XING][xing], building a first-class social network for business professionals in the DACH region. Before that, I helped [Smart Focus][smartfocus] improve their marketing platform which sends messages for billions of clients every month, and also in some startups like [Creditas][creditas], one of the most exciting products on the FinTech market in Brazil.
