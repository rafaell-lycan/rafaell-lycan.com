Hello.

I’m Rafael, a {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }} year old front-end engineer from Brazil who lives in Barcelona.

I’ve been working with web development since 2011, initially as a web designer and front-end developer for a few advertising agencies. Flexible with different working environments, having experience in startups, hybrid studio-agencies, and other large companies.

I like the whole process of front-end development, well-structured and modularized HTML code, to the pixel-perfect code with CSS, through accessibility, performance and concern for SEO. 

I’m also a speaker at local front end, **Angular.js**, and **Node.js** meetups, and I also presented a session at [TDC (The Developers Conference)](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/).

#### Have questions, comments, or just want to say hello?

Feel free to contact me at [sonny.webdsg at gmail dot com](mailto:sonny.webdsg[at]gmail[dot]com).

You can also find me tweeting mostly about software dev on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rafaelllycan).
I also use [github](https://github.com/rafaell-lycan) to store some of my codes and open-source activities.

If you want, see more information on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelllycan/) profile.


Enjoy!
