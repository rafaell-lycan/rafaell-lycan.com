      <h2 class="resume__title">About me</h2>
      <p>I am a front-end developer located in São Paulo, Brazil. I’ve been working with web development since 2011 (and two more years as hobby), initially as a web designer and front-end developer for a few advertising agencies. Flexible with different working environments, having experience in startups, hybrid studio-agencies, and other large companies. Focused primarily on helping agile teams build front-end architecture for mid to large-scale websites and client-side web apps.</p>

      <p>I like the whole process of front-end development, well-structured and modularized HTML code, to the pixel-perfect code with CSS, through accessibility, performance and concern for SEO. </p>
